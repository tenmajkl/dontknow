# dontknow

like 2-3 years ago i wanted to write vim-like terminal based editor in C. I in fact did something in curses but now with the knowledge of automaton i started doing this and its actualy fun (which ive been looking for ayooo)

at this point it has just insert mode with no deleting, normal mode which lets you enter insert mode and quit

BUT i think i would be maybeee able to make more of it idk if i will be insane enough to do so lool

the name is a czenglish pun
